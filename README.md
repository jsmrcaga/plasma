<h1 align="center">Plasma</h1>

A _very_ lightweight Steam headless implementation.
Essentially a spiritual fork of [docker-steam-headless](https://github.com/Steam-Headless/docker-steam-headless)

<img alt="Plasma black hole image" src="docs/banner.png"/>

## Motivation
In short, I wanted to play KSP without installing it in my personal machine.

I was a heavy user of shadow.tech, until price hiked and I could not
justify the monthly cost.

Since then, I started homelabbing, and managed to get a Nvidia Quadro P400 for â‚¬20, which should run KSP.
Since I'm homelabbing, my setup does not have a screen, so here we are.

## Philosophy

> If it works once, it works forever

This project should work for you, _if you're willing to tinker and spend some time_.

The main idea of this project is to allow you to build a durable and running image of headless Steam.
Once that image is proven to work, you should have no more troubles getting it to run. So
if your server/computer/homelab/supercomputer dies because your little cousin tripped over the
power cable, you should be safe to jsut reboot the machine and not worry about libraries
not being up to date or getting a 404 from some driver url.

### What this is and isn't
* This is a different implementation of docker-steam-headless
* This is a "the less entropy the better" slution
* This is not a magic solution to get steam working on your specific setup
* This is not a plug-and-play solution (ie: don't expect that running this docker image will work in your setup)


### Alternative solutions
#### josh5/steam-headless
In short: could not get it to work in ~45 minutes. At the time of writing (May 2025) the latest Docker Hub
and GitHub releases are from 2023, and mirror images had basic errors of file corruption.

#### linuxserver/steam
The last "NVIDIA commit" is not hopeful. I ended up trying the image with an
AMD card but I had no input and Steam was stuck in "webhelper is not responding" (comes pre-installed)

#### Main differences

The main differences with these projects is that this project is not trying
to work "easily" for everyone. This is for targeted setups (headless, nvidia)
but should work a lot more often.

For example, the Nvidia Docker images come with drivers pre-installed (and you
can build your own) to prevent any driver installation issues when executing
the containers. This also allows container boot to be faster.

## Getting Started

### Intel/AMD Graphic Cards
No idea if this works. Most guides seem to suggest that Intel and AMD
cards work a lot better/easier than Nvidia. Let me know!

### Nvidia Graphic Cards
This project releases an Nivida-only image with 

#### Test command (Docker)

NVIDIA
```sh
sudo docker run -it --rm \
	--entrypoint bash \
	--runtime nvidia  \
	--gpus all \
	--shm-size 1g \
	-v /dev/input:/dev/input \
	-v /dev/uinput:/dev/uinput \
	-p 47984-47990:47984-47990/tcp \
	-p 48010:48010 \
	-p 47998-48000:47998-48000/udp \
	--privileged \
	plasma:nvidia-570-test
```

AMD
```sh
sudo docker run -it --rm \
	--entrypoint bash \
	--shm-size 1g \
	-v /dev/input:/dev/input \
	-v /dev/uinput:/dev/uinput \
	-v /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
	-p 47984-47990:47984-47990/tcp \
	-p 48010:48010 \
