## What's Plasma

Plasma is a Steam headless Docker image.

It allows you to run and play Steam games from a headless (no monitor) server with a GPU.
It uses Sunshine and Moonlight to achieve this.

It's meant to be used by people looking specifically for this functionality, and able to develop, maintain and deploy themselves.

If you're here, it's safe to assume you're not looking for pre-made solutions.
But if Plasma does not fit your needs, please take a look to [some alternative solutions](#alternative-solutions).

If you're looking for Cloud gaming services, take a look at [this section of our wiki](https://github.com/jsmrcaga/plasma/wiki#ready-to-use-platforms)

## Getting started
The easiest way to get started with Plasma is to run a pre-baked image. We provide
pre-built images for AMD (`radeon` and `amdgpu` drivers) and the latest 2 NVIDIA drivers.

These images come with sensible defaults, and are pretty much readuy to use.

If you have a specific NVIDIA driver version or wish to modify user/passwords, you'll need
to build an image. Please refer to the wiki for that: https://github.com/jsmrcaga/plasma/wiki

Plasma should take about 35 to 45 seconds to boot (depending on CPU and priming), and you can
check the Telegram notifications feature if you want to be notified when it's ready.
This will also work in case the container restarts.

## Development

Development of Plasma if pretty straightforward. It's a collection of Dockerfiles and
boot scripts that run the necessary processes to run games.
Any time you change something, you need to re-build the image, send it to your
headless server, and try to run it. It's slow, but works pretty well.

Please consult the [Development Wiki Section](https://github.com/jsmrcaga/plasma/wiki) to know
more about contributing.

## Versioning
Plasma versions are based on
- the actual version of the project
- the GPU brand
- the GPU driver version

The `latest` Docker tag will only be used for the base image.

For example, a release may look like this
* `plasma:latest`: the latest version of the base image
* `plasma:v2.3.4`: v2.3.4 of the base image
* `plasma:v2.3.4-AMD-1.0`: v2.3.4 of the AMD image for `radeon` drivers
* `plasma:v2.3.4-AMD-4.0`: v2.3.4 of the AMD image for `amdgpu` drivers
* `plasma:v2.3.4-NVIDIA-570.144`: v2.3.4 of the NVIDIA image for driver version 570.144

The main version follows semver, with breaking changes or "big releases" changing the major 
version, while most releases with new features or non-breaking changes will change the minor version.
Patch versions will change only for smaller updates.

## Motivation
In short, I wanted to play KSP without installing it in my personal machine.

I was a heavy user of shadow.tech, until price hiked and I could not
justify the monthly cost.

Since then, I started homelabbing, and managed to get a Nvidia Quadro P400 for â‚¬20, which should run KSP.
Since I'm homelabbing, my setup does not have a screen, so here we are.

## Philosophy

> If it works once, it works forever

This project should work for you, _if you're willing to tinker and spend some time_.

The main idea of this project is to allow you to build a durable and running image of headless Steam.
Once that image is proven to work, you should have no more trouble getting it to run. So
if your server/computer/homelab/supercomputer dies because your little cousin tripped over the
power cable, you should be safe to just reboot the machine and not worry about libraries
not being up to date or getting a 404 from some driver url.

Note that Steam is a bit different since it auto-updates, but you're free to block that feature
on your first boot.

### What this is and isn't
* This is a different implementation of docker-steam-headless
* This is a "the less entropy the better" solution
* This is not a magic solution to get Steam working on your specific setup
* This is not a plug-and-play solution (ie: don't expect that running this docker image will "just work")

### Alternative solutions

#### [Steam Headless](https://github.com/Steam-Headless/docker-steam-headless)
In short: could not get it to work in ~45 minutes. At the time of writing (May 2025) the latest Docker Hub
and GitHub releases are from 2023, and mirror images had basic errors of file corruption.

#### [linuxserver/steamos](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-steamos/)
The last "NVIDIA commit" is not hopeful. I ended up trying the image with an
AMD card but I had no input at all and Steam was stuck in "webhelper is not responding" (comes pre-installed)

#### [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)
Bazzite is a Linux distribution meant to look and behave like SteamOS.
it does allow you to build from Containerfiles, so it might work as a replacement 
for headless setups with some tinkering.

#### [HoloISO](https://github.com/HoloISO/releases)
Similar to Bazzite, HoloISO is a Linux distribution meant to look and behave like SteamOS.
If you want to just install this to a machine, i'd suggest trying out Bazzite or HoloISO. 

#### Main differences

The main differences with these projects is that this project is not trying
to work "easily" for everyone. This is for targeted setups (notably headless).

For example, the Nvidia Docker images come with drivers pre-installed (and you
can build your own) to prevent any driver installation issues when executing
the containers. This also allows container boot to be faster.

## Getting Started

### AMD Graphic Cards
Plasma has been tested with an AMD Radeon Pro WX 2100.
Configuring Plasma to run with an AMD card is rather easy.

### Nvidia Graphic Cards
Plasma has been tested with an Nvidia Quadro P400.
Configuring for Nvidia is considerably more involved than AMD, but 
it does work well.

### Intel GPUs
Intel GPUs are untested. Use at your own discretion.

#### Test command (Docker)

sudo docker run -it --rm \
	--entrypoint bash \
