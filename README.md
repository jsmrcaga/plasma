A _very_ lightweight Steam headless implementation.

## Motivation
In short, I wanted to play KSP without installing it in my personal machine.

I was a heavy user of shadow.tech, until it became more expensive and I could not
justify the monthly cost.

Since then, I started homelabbing, and managed to get a Nvidia Quadro P400 for â‚¬20, which should run KSP.
Since I'm homelabbing, my setup does not have a screen, so here we are.

### Alternative solutions
#### josh5/steam-headless
In short: could not get it to work in ~45 minutes. At the time of writing (May 2025) the latest Docker Hub
and GitHub releases are from 2023, and mirror images had basic errors of file corruption.

#### linuxserver/steam
The last "nivida commit" is not hopeful. I did not even try the image out.

#### Main differences

The main differences with these projects is that this project is not trying
to work "easily" for everyone. This is for targeted setups (headless, nvidia)
but should work a lot more often.

For example, the Nvidia Docker images come with drivers pre-installed (and you
can build your own) to prevent any driver installation issues when executing
the containers. This also allows container boot to be faster.

## Getting Started

### Intel/AMD Graphic Cards
No idea if this works. Most guides seem to suggest that Intel and AMD
cards work a lot better/easier than Nvidia. Let me know!

### Nvidia Graphic Cards
This project releases an Nivida-only image with 

#### Test command (Docker)
```sh
sudo docker run -it --rm \
	--entrypoint bash \
	--runtime=nvidia  \
	--gpus all \
	-v /dev/input:/dev/input \
	-v /dev/uinput:/dev/uinput \
	-v /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
	--cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
	-p 47984-47990:47984-47990/tcp \
	-p 48010:48010 \
	-p 47998-48000:47998-48000/udp \
